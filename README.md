## Notebook Contents

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset and handle any missing or inconsistent data.
   - Preprocess the data by normalizing or scaling features as required for regression analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze and visualize weather trends over time.
   - Identify patterns and correlations between different weather metrics.

3. **Regression Modeling**:
   - Implement regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to predict weather metrics.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Summarize the findings and provide insights based on the regression analysis.
